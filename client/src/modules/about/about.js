                    The NCI Laboratory of Pathology has implemented a novel
                    clinically-reportable assay that uses genome-wide DNA methylation
                    profiling as a diagnostic tool for tumors of the central nervous
                    system. The validated tool is based, in part, on data published in a
                    recent Nature study (Capper et al., 2018) that showed tumor
                    methylation profiles can serve as an important adjunct and help
                    refine morphology-based diagnostics in tumors of the brain and
                    spinal cord. Notably, methylation results led to diagnostic
                    revisions in a significant proportion (129/139 or 12% of the entire
                    cohort) of cases.This finding was confirmed in five external centers
                    (50/401, 12%), with reclassification rates in 6%-25% of cases.

                    Since its adaptation as an investigative diagnostic tool in 2018,
                    Infinium methylation arrays have led to the identification of new
                    CNS tumor types and subtypes, many of which harbor meaningful
                    associations with clinical course and outcome. Not infrequently,
                    however, classification results may be non-contributory (suboptimal
                    classifier score) or not congruent with the clinical,
                    histopathologic, or molecular features of the case (misleading
                    profile). Interpretation can often be improved with visual
                    inspection of unsupervised UMAP or t-SNE embedding(s).

                    The NCI Laboratory of Pathology is poised to become a diagnostic
                    reference center to implement this tool for diagnostically
                    challenging neuropathology cases. Going forward, it is likely that
                    new methylation-based classifiers will emerge for additional tumor
                    types. Areas of future growth include the implementation of clinical
                    whole-exome sequencing, gene expression diagnostics (RNA-seq), and a
                    dynamic liquid biopsy program.
